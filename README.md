# CC-tweaked-kill-command
*DISCLAIMER* Will kill your computer in minecraft.
This is a kill script for cc tweaked and computercraft.
it can and will destroy your pc upon reboot.
I am also working on it to were it replaces your shutdown and reboot command.
A new kill script should be out within a month or two from the original posting date.
Within a year I plan to code a script that kills all computers on your rednet.
I will inform everyone once this happens cause this could be unwanted in a test enviremont.
To download look for the newest release which is currently 1.1 and get the txt file with the script:
wget run https://github.com/texas845/CC-tweaked-kill-command/releases/download/Version1.1/killscript.1.1.txt                                                   
this will result in the permenent death of your computer it is unavoidable
Enjoy!
